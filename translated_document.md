7:15 what is sup? It is a company that has a mission creating fictional universes that are open and community driven. The first such universe is Blitmap. Any one in the Blitmap community is familiar: initially an art project, that evolved into blitnaut expansion, introduces concept of being a universe, teased some concept art around the ideas of the world, working on the rivals expansion that act as a counterpoint to the blitnauts. There is one installment of a card game called Sugar. And then some more lore work.
